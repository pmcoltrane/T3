# T3 - a wrapper for Okuma's T3 library

## Overview

This is a simple wrapper for fetching status from legacy Okuma CNCs via T3. I've lost the documentation for the underlying library, so I can't guarantee it's correct.

It supports only status, not MacMan data. I'll add that in sometime.

## Notes

For usage, see the readme the T3 project folder.
